# Getting started

You can install the extension very quickly from the VSCode marketplace:

![Installing extension](./ru_gif/install_extension.gif)

To simplify the creation of rules, the most popular templates are used:

![Creating rules from templates](./ru_gif/create_rules_from_templates.gif)

The extension provides auto-completion of taxonomy fields, keywords, functions with their descriptions. Snippets (template pieces of code) are also available to speed up and simplify the addition of XP language constructs:
![Autocomplete and snippets](./ru_gif/hover_autocomplete_snippets.gif)

Testing a rule is the key to its stable and accurate operation without false positives. To do this, you need to create tests. This is how you need to work with integration tests for correlations and enrichments:
![Integration tests](./ru_gif/integration_tests.gif)

You can also test localizations of rules, as well as test multiple rules from the object tree:
![Localization testing and mass testing of rules](./ru_gif/integration_tests.gif)

If you collect events from Windows logs, you can convert them to the desired format as follows:

![Windows events in tests](./ru_gif/xml_to_json.gif)

If you want to correlate EVTX files using selected content:
![Windows events in tests](./ru_gif/evtx_correlator.gif)
